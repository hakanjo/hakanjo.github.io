        <h1>Hello, I'm HÃ¥kan.</h1>
        <p>I'm a self-taught programmer and I write clean human-readable code that is easy to maintain and extend.</p>

        <p>When given the choice or when coding recreationally, I tend to code in Python. Professionally, most of my experience is in writing bash scripts and performing data analysis in <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a><span class="tooltiptext">R is <em>the</em> programming language for statistical computing and graphics in biology.</span></span>. I have also dabbled in web development with HTML/CSS and a small amount of PHP and <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://hakanjo.github.io/temple_of_taiping/index.html">JavaScript</a><span class="tooltiptext">Check out Temple of Taiping (click this link) to see what I can make.</span></span> which I recently picked up again. I also  have a great interest in applied statistics and machine learning and have nurtured this interest by learning Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming using <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a><span class="tooltiptext">Stan is a platform for statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation.</span></span>.</p>

        <p>I have over five years of professional experience in academic research, a large portion of which was spent writing software pipelines. This primarily involved tying disparate pieces of academic software together with Unix shell scripts, <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a><span class="tooltiptext">Make is typically used to build packages, but is also useful to ensure that a research pipeline is reproducible by outlining the input-output relationship between different pieces of software.</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Snakemake</a><span class="tooltiptext">Snakemake is very similar to Make, but more user-friendly. It works very well with Singularity for high-performance computing.</span></span> files, as well as performing documented data analysis with <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a><span class="tooltiptext">R is <em>the</em> programming language for statistical computing and graphics in biology.</span></span> and <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a><span class="tooltiptext">R Markdown is a mix of R and the Markdown markup language, a very useful combination to quickly generate data analysis reports.</span></span>. All while using Git, <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a><span class="tooltiptext">Docker is a platform for defining the environment in which software should exist to ensure that it runs the same way every time. (No more "but it works on my machine"!)</span></span>, and <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://sylabs.io/">Singularity</a><span class="tooltiptext">Singularity is very similar to Docker, but it plays better with multiuser platforms such as high-performance computing clusters.</span></span> to ensure that the research could be reproduced and replicated. However, my most valuable experience was learning how toâ€”as the most experienced programmer in my research groupâ€”tease out the needs and requirements from non-experts and how to explain the possibilities and limitations of different approaches.</p>

        <p>In short, I'm a well organized programmer who easily picks up new tools and techniques. My lack of industry experience sometimes shows and I'm still working on incorporating better testing and version control in my coding habits. Well aware of my weaknesses, I'm constantly working to improve and learn.</p>
